# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains code and resources for classifying iris flowers using machine learning techniques. The iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used as a starting point for learning classification algorithms.

#### Problem Statement:
The main goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

#### Dataset:
The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is labeled with the corresponding iris species.

#### Dependencies:
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

#### Files:
- *iris_flower_classification.ipynb*: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- *iris.csv*: Dataset containing the features and labels for iris flowers.

#### Model Evaluation:
The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix and classification report will be generated to assess the model's performance in detail.

#### Results:
The final trained model (Decision Tree) is able to classify iris flowers into their respective species with high accuracy. Visualization techniques such as scatter plots and decision boundaries will be used to illustrate the model's performance.
